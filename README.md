# Workshop with Google!
Last year, COVID-19 locked us home and upended our lives.

They were hard times for many, and we want to explore the relationship between **our struggles** and **our solidarity** during the pandemic using [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/).

The idea for this project is to visualize the dichotomy: 
* **Who/When/Where/What for we ask for help**,
* **Who/When/Where/What for we offer help**.

A look at the trend in the last 5 years shows [a peak around March last year](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=help) ... was it the pandemic? 

For example mental health issues, international solidarity and ways to support Black Lives Matter pop up in this view of [last year's trending topics](https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2020/US/#4816dfbf-7056-428a-a89d-03bbd4a29ba6)

We're thrilled to count with the support of [Google News Lab](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/google-news-lab): [Simon Rogers](https://simonrogers.net/) and [Alberto Cairo](http://albertocairo.com/) will assit with the data, editorial and visual angle of this project!! They'll also be joining us at the hackathon on May 15.

## In this repository
In the [`app`](app) folder you'll find a boilerplate(ish) template, it's similar to the `mvtec-svelte-app`, with the addition of `svelte-materialify` —so we don't spend too much time overdesigning the UI.

You also have a [`data`](data) folder. Think of it as the playground for your data. 

## Let your imagination run wild ...
Over the years, designers have taken many different approaches to visualize [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/). Find some inspirations here:
* [Waves of Interest](https://waves-of-interest.truth-and-beauty.net/#US)
* [A Year in Lockdown Trends](https://lockdown-trends.appspot.com/)
* [The Shape of Dreams](https://the-shape-of-dreams.com/)
* [The Rhythm of Food](http://rhythm-of-food.net/)
* [Why Do Cats & Dogs ...?](https://whydocatsanddogs.com/)
* [Explore Adventure](http://explore-adventure.com/)

## ... well, wild(ish), the piece has to have ...
These are *mandatory* bits you'd need to include in the piece, they can be ordered however you want though (yes, you can even start with something before the title! That's called a cold open.)

* **Title and intro:** What am I gonna see here?
* **Hero visualization:** The star of the show 🤩! Unleash your creativity!
* **Guiding text and annotations:** A bit of hand-holding through the visual, to explain noticeable bits in the views
* **Small multiples:** Still cool, but in a *cool aunt* kind of way 😎
* **Filters:** They can be a dropdown menu, buttons, sliders, [chips](https://svelte-materialify.vercel.app/components/chips/) ... that transform or reduce the data you're visualizing

## Audience
General public. 

## About the data
This [post](https://medium.com/google-news-lab/what-is-google-trends-data-and-what-does-it-mean-b48f07342ee8) by [Simon Rogers](https://twitter.com/smfrogers) explains the nitty gritty of the data.

Also, this [post about process](https://truth-and-beauty.net/projects/waves-of-interest) from Moritz Stefaner is worth a read.
